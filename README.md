## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a dedicated and highly motivated **Software Developer** with a strong foundation in computer science, problem-solving, and real-world application development.  
With hands-on experience in full-stack development and a passion for building scalable, user-centric products, I consistently strive to create software that’s clean, efficient, and impactful.

I specialize in backend development using **Python (Django, Flask)** and have experience building REST APIs, deploying apps using **Docker**, and working with cloud services. On the frontend, I enjoy creating smooth user experiences with **React** and modern JavaScript.

I regularly enhance my algorithmic thinking through platforms like **LeetCode**, where I’ve solved 300+ challenges. I also enjoy participating in coding competitions and have a keen interest in system design and scalable architecture.

I’m driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a strong desire to contribute to meaningful projects — values that deeply align with Google’s mission of organizing the world’s information and making it universally accessible and useful.

Currently, I’m seeking opportunities where I can work on challenging problems, learn from world-class engineers, and grow as a developer and innovator.
